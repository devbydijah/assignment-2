          My Tech Journey: A Bit Unexpected, But Totally Awesome
        </h2>
        <p class="text-content">
          My love for computers started when I was a teenager. I was always
          curious about how websites and apps worked, so I started learning more
          about it. After attending a coding bootcamp, I knew I had found my
          thing! I discovered that I could use my coding skills to build cool
          stuff that could actually help people.

          communities, especially in Africa, to connect, communicate, and
          resolve conflicts peacefully. I'm also a huge advocate for women in
          tech, and I believe that by giving women the skills and resources they
          need, we can create a brighter future for everyone.

        <p class="text-content">
          Frontend software engineering involves the development of the user
          interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and applications.
          This field focuses on creating visually appealing and intuitive
          interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. Frontend
          developers use technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build
          responsive and dynamic web pages. They also work with frameworks and
          libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js to enhance functionality and
          streamline the development process. The primary goal is to ensure that
          users can interact with the digital product easily and effectively.
          The video will talk more about frontend software engineering and its
          importance in modern web development.
