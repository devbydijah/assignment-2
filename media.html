          I'm the youngest of five sisters, and I'm from the awesome city of
          Kano in Nigeria. Growing up with all those amazing sisters was quite
          an experience.

        <h2>My Tech Journey: A Bit Unexpected, But Totally Awesome</h2>
        <p>
          My love for computers started when I was a teenager. I was always
          curious about how websites and apps worked, so I started learning more
          about it. After attending a coding bootcamp, I knew I had found my
          thing! I discovered that I could use my coding skills to build cool
          stuff that could actually help people.

        <h2>Life Beyond the Keyboard</h2>
        <p>
          Besides coding, I love reading, hiking, doing yoga, and checking out
          the latest tech gadgets. I even like to play around with website
          builders like Wix. Writing is another one of my passions, especially
          my morning journal entries, which help me stay focused and get my
          creative juices flowing.

        <h2>My Dream: Tech for a Better World</h2>
        <p>
          My big dream is to combine my love for technology with my passion for
          peacebuilding. I want to create tools and platforms that help
          communities, especially in Africa, to connect, communicate, and
          resolve conflicts peacefully. I'm also a huge advocate for women in
          tech, and I believe that by giving women the skills and resources they
          need, we can create a brighter future for everyone.

        <h2>Always Learning and Giving Back</h2>
        <p>
          I'm always looking for new ways to learn and grow, whether it's by
          taking online courses, attending workshops, or reading up on the
          latest tech trends. I also believe in giving back to my community,
          which is why I volunteer at local schools to teach kids about coding
          and technology.

        <h2>Frontend Software Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          Frontend software engineering involves the development of the user
          interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and applications.
          This field focuses on creating visually appealing and intuitive
          interfaces that provide a seamless user experience. Frontend
          developers use technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build
          responsive and dynamic web pages. They also work with frameworks and
          libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js to enhance functionality and
          streamline the development process. The primary goal is to ensure that
          users can interact with the digital product easily and effectively.
          The video will talk more about frontend software engineering and its
          importance in modern web development.
