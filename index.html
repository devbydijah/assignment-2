        <p>
          I'm the youngest of five sisters, and I'm from the awesome city of
          Kano in Nigeria. Growing up with all those amazing women definitely
          shaped who I am todayâ€”someone who loves technology and wants to use it
          to make the world a better place. I'm studying Peace and Conflict
          Studies, but I'm also super passionate about coding and all things
          tech.

        <h3>My Tech Journey: A Bit Unexpected, But Totally Awesome</h3>
        <p>
          My love for computers started when I was a teenager. I was always
          curious about how websites and apps worked, so I started learning more
          about it. After attending a coding bootcamp, I knew I had found my
          thing! I discovered that I could use my coding skills to build cool
          stuff that could actually help people.

        <h3>Life Beyond the Keyboard</h3>
        <p>
          Besides coding, I love reading, hiking, doing yoga, and checking out
          the latest tech gadgets. I even like to play around with website
          builders like Wix. Writing is another one of my passions, especially
          my morning journal entries, they help me stay focused and get my
          creative juices flowing.

        <h3>My Dream: Tech for a Better World</h3>
        <p>
          My big dream is to combine my love for technology with my passion for
          peacebuilding. I want to create tools and platforms that help
          communities, especially in Africa, to connect, communicate, and
          resolve conflicts peacefully. I'm also a huge advocate for women in
          tech, and I believe that by giving women the skills and resources they
          need, we can create a brighter future for everyone.

        <h3>Always Learning and Giving Back</h3>
        <p>
          I'm a big believer in always learning and growing. That's why I've
          been teaching myself graphic design using tools like Canva and Adobe.
          I also love volunteering my time with organizations like Nigerian
          Mental Health and The Book Bank Africa. Giving back to my community is
          super important to me.
